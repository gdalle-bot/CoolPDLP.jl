"""
    write_time!(out)

Write the current host time into the single-element output buffer of a Reactant callback.

`Reactant.Ops.julia_callback` hands the callback its output buffers first and its inputs
afterwards, and a `()`-shaped output arrives dereferenced, as a plain `Float64` with nothing to
write into. The output is therefore declared with shape `(1,)` and reduced back to a scalar on
the traced side.

write_time!(out::AbstractVector{Float64}) = (out[1] = time(); nothing)

"""
    host_callbacks_supported()

Whether `Reactant.Ops.julia_callback` can be serviced on the backend currently in use.

`Reactant.Ops._wrap_buffers` hands the callback its buffers directly on the host, goes through
`CUDA.jl` on the CUDA backend, and raises on every other one. A callback that raises is caught
inside Reactant's trampoline, which logs it and reports failure *on every call* rather than
stopping the run, so an unusable callback surfaces as a hang rather than as an error. Better
not to emit one at all.

"""
    frozen_clock()

Read the clock the old way, for backends that cannot run a host callback.

The value is read once while tracing and baked into the compiled program as a constant, so the
elapsed time never advances and the time limit never fires. Warn rather than fail: everything
else about a compiled solve still works, and the KKT pass budget still bounds it.

    @warn """
    This Reactant backend cannot run a host callback, so the elapsed time inside a compiled \
    solve stays frozen at its compilation-time value and `time_limit` will not be enforced. \
    Loading CUDA.jl lifts this on the CUDA backend.""" maxlog = 1

"""
    CoolPDLP.current_time()

Read the host clock from inside a compiled program.

Tracing `Base.time()` would freeze its trace-time value into the compiled program as a
constant, so the elapsed time would never advance and the time limit could never fire.
`Reactant.Ops.julia_callback` emits a `stablehlo.custom_call` back into Julia instead, which is
re-evaluated at every iteration of the compiled loop.

`has_side_effect = true` marks that call impure, so the compiler may not hoist it out of the
loop, share it across iterations or drop it when its result looks unused — each of which would
put the frozen clock back. With `has_side_effect = false` the emitted call is pure and all
three become legal.

The single-element reduction that turns the callback's output back into a scalar costs nothing:
it compiles down to a `stablehlo.reshape`.
